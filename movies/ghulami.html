    <h3>Does Ghulami succeed?</h3>
    <p>
      Ghulami is a movie made with a lot of soul and it shows in some of its
      best moments. I saw it on youtube where the print was barely decent, and
      song audios were copyrighted out - so I guess I must take the fair share
      of blame on this. But moving on...

      There are so many conversations that stand out. One of them is between
      Sumitra and Mora where they come close to each other after Sumitra has
      returned to Fatehpur.
