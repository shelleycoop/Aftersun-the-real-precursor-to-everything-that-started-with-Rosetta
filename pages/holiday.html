      I am on a permanent holiday of sorts. And the inertia is so real. I can't
      help it but be on a vacation and so I am on a vacation even now, three
      years after finishing college. And it took me an extraordinary amount of
      time to finish college as well.

      Obviously, I am not proud of it all. But at times it was necessary for
      things to be like that given my situation in life.

    <p>
      And to understand me completely one must know that above all I value
      personal dignity and freedom and uphold these ideals for everyone.
