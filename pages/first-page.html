            I am very obsessed with this movie because it hangs like a warning
            to me. My own life is following a trajectory where this movie always
            acts like a warning, a cautionary tale, to take proper care to avoid
            the situation in which the protagonist, the father, has landed in
            the movie, as the movie implies. And I am hyper-aware and maybe
            extra cautious. But come to think of it, the father wasn't really
            living. But what living really is. How can decide if one is living
            their life or not. We all have roles given to us by family, society,
            by us ourselves. And we try to hold on to those mirrors. It is so
            sad. So sad that we never break free.

            Why does Sanjeev want to say so many things. Why is he not mastering
            the art of keeping it inside himself. Well, there can be many
            answers to this that Sanjeev himself can tell. But there is one very
            appropriate and true response. And that is - Sanjeev wants to
            contribute to changing the world, slowly and steadily, but surely.

            Now this little girl, she is a source of enormous wisdom for
            Sanjeev. Her memories are guiding Sanjeev and sometimes even scare
            him in the process of letting him in on profound knowledge about
            life. that wisdom man!

            She actually could be quite like Nitica to him. There is however the
            complicated aspect of a father-daughter relationship in the movie
            which he wouldn't want in his reality though.. lol stuff it is
            really.
