      Of all the stories grandmother used to tell us this was the one that used
      to scare us the most. And as I grew older I find this was because there
      was an aspect of truth to this story. This story was about a particular
      street in the outer limits of our city and involved encounters with a sort
      of supernatural being as retold by numerous strangers who passed through
      that street at a certain time of the night when locals refrained
      themselves from doing so. This thing of it being true was what that
      chilled our spine even after our grandfather had left us a long time ago.

      But when this tale begun we were really small and that part of town was
      still underdeveloped. Darkness used to cover the streets like a thick
      black blanket. It was in every way a perfect spot for such an unusual
      event to happen. But back then it was for us a myth and nothing more. But
      now as we had grown older and all of us siblings were in the city the old
      memories cropped up in conversation and this was highlighted out of
      nowhere as an eventuality.

      It started with a lightness in mood but slowly as we explored more aspects
      of the story a hush started to fill the room until there came a moment of
      a scared silence in which someone put forward the idea that it would be so
      exciting to visit that place now as we had never did it actually and had
      only heard stories about it. This lead to an understandable hesitation
      among a few of us but their was one cousin who liked to showcase his
      bravado and was the first one to say that yes we must do it because why
      not. We will have a fun time and plenty of thrill along the way and can
      count it as a adventure when we would soon return to our separate lives.

      Still it tool some convincing for the eager ones to convince the rest of
      the group and even then there was one of us who couldn't be bought into
      the plan. So, it was decided for us to visit over there two days later
      late in the evening after darkness envelopes the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the said night it took some convincing again but we did leave for the
      said spot. One of our cousins stood behind. Some of us already had our
      memory playing tricks on us as we were having glimpses of an unknown
      terror in a part of our brains that caused a chill in our senses. Yet we
      took the bus that passed through there. After a ride of thirty-five
      minutes the bus dropped at the station. The said street we asked the
      locals and they told us that it was very near but it would be only after
      an hour or two that the strangeness would manifest itself which meant that
      we had to wait for a long time before we got our kicks.

      We went to a park and lied down on the grass. The skies were blank here
      for some reason. The stars were not visible. We all sensed something
      sinister about the whole thing until one of us remarked that if we had
      seen the faces of the people who had told us about the place. At that
      moment our hearts fainted out of pure dread as we realised our grave
      mistake. We had taken those guys for people. They weren't.
