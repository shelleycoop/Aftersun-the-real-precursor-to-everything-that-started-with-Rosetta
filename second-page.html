        I don't really want to spoil anything for the reader here. Because this is a movie
        that has to felt by the heart and it will end up enriching the soul ultimately. I 
        still am processing this one and it takes a good look at what can go wrong in life
        in between little moments with family or friends. Little hurts that can lead to large
        wounds.
